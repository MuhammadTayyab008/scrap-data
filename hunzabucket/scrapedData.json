    "description": "Gymnema Tea is handpicked from the fields in Hunza Valley of Gilgit Baltistan. Gymnema Sylvestre is a woody climbing shrub, its leaves Â have been used in the ancient Indian medicinal practice Ayurveda for thousands of years. It is also known as Sugar Destroyer.This tea is not your everyday herbal tea that may smell or taste good. But as expected I have found amazing results in managing my diabetes. After using it for some time, unlike before I have started getting up fresh in the morning, lessoning the frequency of trips to the toilet, skin feels better as dryness is gone and the sudden pangs of hunger have been reduced too.This tea is an amazing supplement if youâ€™re a diabetic. I bought the tea for my mother and J have felt a clear change in her mood as the extreme thirst and frequent urination urge has been reduced in a span of only two weeks usage. Itâ€™s good that these guys press on the fact that it should be used along with the medication prescribed by the doctor as it doesnâ€™t replace the medicine fully but it clearly  helps in managing the most common symptoms.Over the top, great, amazing and truthful. Works very well. Been a diabetic since age 12, never had a product as good as this.\nOne suggestion, decrease the price.Oh yes it really works.Lowers and controls my blood sugar.I m startingExcellentToo soon to say how effective the tea is. But the delivery was on time and very neat and clean packaging.If somebody is patient of type 2 diabetes can use it or not??as well as bp patient can use it or not please replyHi, Itâ€™s important for individuals with type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure to consult their doctor before making any dietary changes. They can guide you according to your medical history. Regards",

Thank you!At age 55, my husband has been diagnosed with prostate issues and stress levels high.

    "description": "TumuroTea or Wild Mountain Thyme is handpicked from the pastures in Hunza Valley of GilgitBaltistan. It is a herb that grows on high altitude and is purely organic. People of Hunza specially visit pastures/meadows to collect Tumuro, dry and store it.I have been using this magical tea for about three weeks now and I tell you it has been an amazing addition to my both main meals of the day. From smell to taste and the effects that I have felt are brilliant. I have serious sinus issues but using Tamuro tea after dinner has given me a good nights sleep and fresh mornings as the nose blockades have reduced. It maybe too early to say but I have felt lighter than before ( wont share my weight here now) but I am sure it works in digestion too.In love with the aroma and the soothing effect of this tea. A warm cup of Tumuro also helps me destress after workout. Highly recommended!",
